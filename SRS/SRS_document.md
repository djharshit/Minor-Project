# Preposition Error Detection Machine Learning Project SRS Document

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to provide a comprehensive overview of the requirements for a machine learning project focused on detecting preposition errors in written English text. This project aims to produce a system that can analyze a given text document and identify any errors in the use of prepositions, providing suggested corrections where applicable.

Preposition errors are common among English language learners and can affect their ability to express themselves clearly and effectively. The preposition error detection machine learning project aims to address this problem by providing a system that can automatically detect such errors and suggest corrections to users. By providing a more efficient and accurate means of identifying preposition errors, this project can improve the English language proficiency of learners and help them communicate more effectively.

## 2. Goals

The primary goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient machine learning model that can effectively detect preposition errors in English text. Other goals of this project include:

- Identifying common types of preposition errors made by English language learners
- Creating a user-friendly interface for inputting and analyzing text documents
- Developing an effective system for suggesting corrections to identified errors

In addition to the primary goal of developing an accurate and efficient machine learning model, additional goals can be established. For instance, the project may aim to identify common types of preposition errors made by English language learners, and provide targeted correction suggestions for each type. Additionally, creating a user-friendly interface that is accessible to a wide range of users with varying technical proficiency and language skills is another important goal. The SRS should also outline a roadmap of how each goal will be reached.

## 3. Scope

The scope of this project includes developing a machine learning model that can accurately detect preposition errors in English text. The model should be capable of analyzing a variety of text documents, including essays, articles, and other written materials. The system should also be easily accessible to users through a web-based interface, allowing them to easily upload documents and receive feedback on preposition errors. The system will identify errors based on the user's desired level of correction, ranging from simple suggestions to detailed explanations and grammatical guidelines.

An important factor to consider is the desired level of interaction with the user i.e. whether the system will simply highlight detected errors, provide suggested corrections, or provide detailed feedback for users unfamiliar with English grammar rules.

## 4. Requirements

The functional requirements outline what the system should do, while the non-functional requirements are characteristics of the system that are not directly observable by the user.

### 4.1. Functional Requirements

The following are the functional requirements for the preposition error detection machine learning project:

1. The system should be able to accept input text from a variety of file formats including TXT, DOC, and PDF.
2. The system should include a user interface that allows users to easily upload files, analyze text documents, and receive feedback on preposition errors.
3. The system should be able to detect common types of preposition errors made by English language learners, including incorrect use of prepositions, preposition omissions, and preposition substitutions.
4. The system should be able to provide suggested corrections for identified errors.
5. The system should be able to identify errors in text documents of varying lengths and complexity, including essays, articles, and other written materials.
6. The system should be able to handle multiple users simultaneously and maintain data security and confidentiality.
7. The system should provide detailed feedback on identified errors, including grammatical explanations and guidelines for correction.
8. The system should be adaptable to different levels of error correction desired by the user.

For instance, the system should be able to accept text documents in various formats such as .txt, .doc, and .pdf. Users should also be able to access the system through a web-based interface that accepts uploaded documents in these formats. Additionally, the system should effectively detect preposition errors even in longer, more complex documents.

### 4.2. Non-functional Requirements

The following are the non-functional requirements for the preposition error detection machine learning project:

1. The system should be able to handle a large volume of text documents without significant delay in processing time.
2. The system should be able to maintain a high level of accuracy in detecting preposition errors.
3. The system should be able to handle different accents and dialects of English.
4. The system should be easily navigable and user-friendly, with clear prompts and instructions for input and output.
5. The system should be able to maintain user privacy and confidentiality in regards to uploaded materials and identified errors.
6. The system should have a detailed user manual that provides clear instructions for use.

Non-functional requirements can include the system's processing speed, the maximum duration of analysis the system can perform, and the level of data security that the system offers.

## 5. Assumptions and Constraints

The following are the assumptions and constraints for the preposition error detection machine learning project:

### 5.1. Assumptions

1. The system will be designed to operate exclusively in the English language.
2. Training data for the machine learning model will be obtained from a reliable and diverse corpus of English text materials.
3. The system will require a reliable and stable internet connection for web-based access and operation.
4. The system will require ongoing updates and maintenance to ensure optimal functionality and accuracy.
5. The system will be accessible to a wide range of users, including those with varying levels of technological proficiency and language skills.
6. The system will solely work with the English language.
7. The system will require large amounts of training data to optimize accuracy.

### 5.2. Constraints

1. The system will be built to address common preposition errors made by English language learners.
2. The system should maintain user confidentiality and privacy.
3. The system should be accessible to users on various device types, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
4. The system will require ongoing maintenance and updates to stay current and efficient.

## 6. Conclusion

The preposition error detection machine learning project aims to develop a system that can accurately and efficiently detect errors in the use of prepositions in English text materials. Through careful consideration of the project goals, requirements, and constraints, this SRS document provides a comprehensive overview of the project scope and implementation.

By providing a comprehensive overview of the project, stakeholders can easily assess the feasibility and scope of the project before it begins. Any questions regarding the project should also be addressed in the conclusion section to ensure clear communication between stakeholders and the developers.
