Preposition Error Detection Machine Learning Project

1. Introduction

The Preposition Error Detection Machine Learning Project is a software system designed to detect preposition errors in written English text. The software system will be developed using machine learning algorithms that will be trained on a large dataset of annotated texts containing preposition errors. The system will be able to identify errors in preposition usage in text and provide suggestions for the correct usage.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1. User Interface

The system will have a user interface that allows users to input text and receive feedback on preposition errors in the text.

2.2. Error Detection

The system will use machine learning algorithms to detect preposition errors in the input text.

2.3. Error Correction

The system will provide suggestions for correcting preposition errors in the input text.

2.4. Training Data

The system will require a large dataset of annotated texts containing preposition errors to train the machine learning algorithms.

2.5. Performance

The system will be able to detect preposition errors with a high degree of accuracy.

3. Non-functional Requirements

3.1. Performance

The system will be able to detect preposition errors in a timely manner.

3.2. Reliability

The system will be reliable and able to handle large volumes of input text.

3.3. Scalability

The system will be scalable and able to handle a large number of users simultaneously.

3.4. Security

The system depends on machine learning tools and libraries to train and test the algorithms.

5. Constraints

5.1. Hardware Constraints

The system requires a powerful computer system to train the machine learning algorithms.

5.2. Time Constraints

The system requires time to train the machine learning algorithms and tune the system.

6. System Architecture

The system will be designed using the following architecture:

6.1. Data Ingestion Layer

This layer will be responsible for ingesting user input data.

6.2. Preprocessing Layer

This layer will be responsible for preprocessing the input data, such as removing stop words and punctuation.

6.3. Feature Extraction Layer

This layer will extract features from the preprocessed data, such as n-grams and word embeddings.

6.4. Machine Learning Layer

This layer will use the extracted features to train machine learning algorithms to detect preposition errors in the input text.

6.5. Error Correction Layer

This layer will provide suggestions for correcting preposition errors in the input text.

6.6. User Interface Layer

This layer will provide a user interface for users to input text and receive feedback on preposition errors in the text.
